    Evaluate these (ie True or False)

    [2] === [2] 
    {} === {}


    What is, for each object below, the value of the property number and why?

    const object1 = { number: 5 }; 
    const object2 = object1; 
    const object3 = object2; 
    const object4 = { number: 5};

    object1.number = 4;
    console.log(object2.number)
    console.log(object3.number)
    console.log(object4.number)


    Create a class Animal with the attributes name, type and color. The type is the animal type, for example: dog, cat, dolphin etc ‚Ä¶

    Create a class Mammal that extends from the Animal class. Inside the class, add a method called sound(). This method takes a parameter: the sound the animal makes, and returns the details of the animal (name, type and color) as well as the sound it makes.

    Create a farmerCow object that is an instance of the class Mammal. The object accepts a name, a type and a color and calls the sound method that ‚Äúmoos‚Äù her information.
    For example: Moooo I'm a cow, named Lily and I'm brown and white



*/
// object2 and object3 will have the value 4 because they reference the same object as object1,
// object4 will have the value 5


// Base class
class Animal {
  constructor(name, type, color) {
    this.name = name;
    this.type = type;
    this.color = color;
  }
}

// Subclass
class Mammal extends Animal {
  sound(sound) {
    return `${sound} I'm a ${this.type}, named ${this.name} and I'm ${this.color}`;
  }
}

// Create instance
const farmerCow = new Mammal("Lily", "cow", "brown and white");
console.log(farmerCow.sound("Moooo"));
